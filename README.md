## Introduction

AutoML is an open-source project that aims to simplify the machine learning process for everyone. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly and accessible platform for data scientists, researchers, and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models with ease.

## Features

* **Automated Machine Learning**: AutoML provides a range of automated machine learning algorithms that can be used to build and train models with minimal effort.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Our platform includes a range of data preprocessing tools that can be used to clean, transform, and prepare data for machine learning.
* **Model Evaluation**: AutoML provides a range of model evaluation metrics that can be used to assess the performance of machine learning models.
* **Model Deployment**: Our platform includes a range of model deployment options that can be used to deploy machine learning models in a production-ready environment.
